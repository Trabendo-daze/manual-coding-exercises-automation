# manual-coding-exercises-automation

A manual coding exercise is a methodology for analyzing text data where analysts read through units of text data and label it for the presence or absence of a set number of themes (called codes) in order to quantify the frequency of those themes in the data. This series of RMarkdown documents is part of a talk (based on the slides below) aimed at simplifying this process by taking advantage of R and RStudio. Note that this workflow is best done within an RStudio Project Folder.
